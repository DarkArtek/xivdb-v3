XIVDB keeps a track record of Final Fantasy XIV client patches for many pieces of content.

## `/PatchList`

Get's a list of all patches that have been recorded on XIVDB. Some very minor patches are missing because they were either small hot-fixes or provided no additional content.


### `GamePatch`
